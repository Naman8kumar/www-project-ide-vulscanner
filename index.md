Most of the vulnerability scanner tools caters to code which is built and ready for deployment. Most commonly tools used are Snyk, SonarQube and others. IDE-VulScanner is a IDE agnostic tool for developers to identify vulnerable code dependencies during implementation phase, which in-tern would save huge security patching cost identified via CI/CD pipelines otherwise.

### Features
• Vulnerability code scan during implementation phase
• Save security patch & maintenance cost
• Low overall high & critical vulnerabilities
• Works for all the know IDEs i.e. Intellij, eclipse, VS Code etc.
